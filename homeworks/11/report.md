## Communication among boards with keypad and led matrix

Objective of the project is to make two boards communicate with the on-board keypad and led matrix. The idea is to press a button on the keypad and have the symbol shop up on another board by transmitting commands via the IR link.

Since this is the last project of the course we decided to showcase also the LCD, the quadrature encoder and the potentiometer by implementing an identification system for the board. The idea is that via the LCD and the two knobs, the user can set an identification number for the board and specify a destination address for the commands. This way we can setup each board with a different identifier and select which one to send our data to.

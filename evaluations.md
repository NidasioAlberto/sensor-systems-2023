| 1       | 2023/10/03                           | A-         | In PartA do you noticed any bouncing problems? Try to solve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2       | 2023/10/10 (delivered on 25/10/2023) | B          | Part A1: Better to use the functions _HAL_TIM_SET_AUTOREALOAD, _HAL_TIM_SET_COMPARE, etc... instead of copying the entire MX_TIM1_Init. Part A2: It’s very strange that modifying the priority of the interrupt you haven’t solved the issue. I strongly recommend to figure out the reason with the tutor, because for sure you are doing something wrong. Part B: good                     |
| 2       | 2023/10/18                           | A          | Very good! I appreciate that you describe the problems you encountered and how you solved them!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4       | 2023/10/24                           | A-         | “HAL_TIM_Base_Start_IT(&htim2);” you don’t need to start it in IT mode when you use a timer as a trigger. In this way you are interrupting the core without any reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5       | 2023/11/07                           | B          | Part 3A: Your “while(!resultValid){}”, is a blocking function (mainly the same as HAL_DELAY). You should a more efficient way, not blocking the main (using interrupts…). Part 3B:   In other to optimize this project you should have used ADC with DMA and filling the 1000 element buffer (thus the conversion completed callback is called only once all the 100 elements are converted) |
